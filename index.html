<p>This is the next version of simple music player (<a href="http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/">SimpleMP</a>)</p>

<p><strong>SimpleMP</strong> or <strong>Simple Music Player</strong> is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.</p>

<p>Why another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.
I used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)
Unfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.</p>

<p>After long time, now it's time to make a new one!</p>

<p>It's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.</p>

<p><strong><em>Use it with your own risk!</em></strong></p>

<a name="first-simple-functions" class="anchor" href="#first-simple-functions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First simple functions</h1>

<ul>

<li>Drag&amp;Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop files within the playlist</li>
<li>Add directories to the medialib (not yet finished)</li>
<li>Simple equalizer</li>
<li>Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus

<ul>
<li>
<strong>[Space]</strong> play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)</li>
<li>
<strong>[Enter]</strong> play selected files</li>
<li>
<strong>[Del]</strong> delete selected files from current playlist</li>

</li>
<li>Flexible, responsive UI (different views for different window sizes)</li>

<li>Working as single instance, that means

<ul>
<li>if you try start the player twice you get always the first started player</li>
